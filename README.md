### Introduction
Droptiles is a "Windows 8 Start" like Web 2.0 Dashboard. It compromises of Live Tiles. Tiles are mini apps that can fetch data from external sources. Clicking on a tile launches the full application. Applications can be from any existing website to customized website built specifically to fit the Dashboard experience. 
Droptiles is built almost entirely of HTML, Javascript and CSS and thus highly portable to any platform. The sample project is built using ASP.NET to show some server side integration, like Signup, Login and getting dynamic data from server. But with very little change you can port it to PHP, Ruby, JSP or any other platform.
Droptiles is inspired by [Dropthings](http://dropthings.omaralzabir.com/), which is another Web 2.0 Dashboard.

### Features

* Client side object model and data binding for easy MVVM implementation.
* Server side platform neutral implementation. Can be ported to PHP, JSP easily.
* Live tiles. Tiles are mini-apps, loading data from variety of sources.
* Drag & Drop tiles to personalize the experience. 

### Who am I?
I am the Chief Architect of SaaS Platform, BT (aka British Telecom). Ex Co-Founder and CTO of the first Web 2.0 Social Start Page - Pageflakes, owner of highly popular open source projects - [Dropthings](http://dropthings.omaralzabir.com), [Codeuml.com](http://codeuml.com). 

### License
Droptiles is free for personal use as long as you keep the copyright notices intact. But for commercial use, it costs $499 per server, per site for non-redistributable license. Please email me at "OmarALZabir at gmail dot com" and let me know how many servers or sites you want to install and I will send you an invoice. Then you can Paypal/Bank wire me and I will send you a signed license for your company.

### Technologies
* jQuery for all client side effects.
* KnockoutJS for client side Object Model and data binding.
* UnderscoreJS
* Bootstrap for CSS and JS plugins

### Why shouldn't I just code it myself?
* Droptiles has 100+ hours of my effort and over 300+ hours of community effort to get where it is now. If you try to build it from scratch, by the time you get to production quality, you would likely have spent more money than just buying commercial license for the code.
* Droptiles has a highly readable, extensible, maintainable codebase. 
* Droptiles is a minimalistic framework to build apps on top of it. It’s not a full blown CMS, which you need to spend months learning in order to customize it. The codebase is small, and highly reusable – making it very easy to build bespoke sites on top of it.
* Droptiles will force your developers to use industry best practices. For instance, using MVVM architecture, building sites on top of cross-browser CSS and JS frameworks, pluggable architecture where features are dynamically loaded and so on.
* Droptiles is built specifically to be integrated with existing ASP.NET/PHP/JSP/Ruby web applications, where most other CMS are built to be run as a standalone app.
